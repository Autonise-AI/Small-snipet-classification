#Topics Explored by us

- Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification
- FastText for Classification
- Naive Bayes for Classification
- Unsupervised Clustering


#Results

The results have been tabulated in the File Results for all the grid runs.

- FastText gave the best results
- Naive Bayes approach gave intermediatery results
- Convolutional Neural Networks performed the worst because of overfitting
